## What is Availability?
Availability refers to the proportion of time a system is operational and accessible when required.

It is usually expressed as a percentage, indicating the system's uptime over a specific period.

The formal definition of availability is:

Availability = Uptime / (Uptime + Downtime)
Availability is often expressed in "nines". The higher the availability, the less downtime there is.

## Strategies for Improving Availability
## 1. Redundancy
     
    - Server Redundancy: Deploying multiple servers to handle requests, ensuring that if one server fails, others can continue to provide service.
    
    - Database Redundancy: Creating a replica database that can take over if the primary database fails.
    
    - Geographic Redundancy: Distributing resources across multiple geographic locations to mitigate the impact of regional failures.

## 2. Load Balancing

## 3. Failover Mechanisms
Failover mechanisms automatically switch to a redundant system when a failure is detected.
    Active-Passive Failover: A primary active component is backed by a passive standby component that takes over upon failure.
    
    Active-Active Failover: All components are active and share the load. If one fails, the remaining components continue to handle the load seamlessly.

## 4. Data Replication
Data replication involves copying data from one location to another to ensure that data is available even if one location fails.

    Synchronous Replication: Data is replicated in real-time to ensure consistency across locations.
    
    Asynchronous Replication: Data is replicated with a delay, which can be more efficient but may result in slight data inconsistencies.

## 5. Monitoring and Alerts
